NEURAL NETWORK TRAINING PROCEDURES

1. DATA PREPARATION
   - Collect and clean training data
   - Split into train/validation/test sets (70/15/15)
   - Normalize input features to zero mean, unit variance
   - Apply data augmentation if applicable

2. MODEL INITIALIZATION
   - Initialize weights using Xavier or He initialization
   - Set appropriate learning rate (typically 1e-3 to 1e-4)
   - Choose optimizer (Adam, SGD, RMSprop)
   - Define loss function based on task type

3. TRAINING LOOP
   For each epoch:
     a. Shuffle training data
     b. For each batch:
        - Forward pass: compute predictions
        - Calculate loss
        - Backward pass: compute gradients
        - Update parameters using optimizer
     c. Evaluate on validation set
     d. Log metrics and save checkpoints

4. HYPERPARAMETER TUNING
   - Learning rate: Start with 1e-3, adjust based on loss curves
   - Batch size: Balance between memory and gradient stability
   - Architecture: Number of layers, hidden units, activation functions
   - Regularization: Dropout rate, weight decay

5. MONITORING AND DEBUGGING
   - Track training/validation loss curves
   - Monitor gradient norms to detect vanishing/exploding gradients
   - Use early stopping to prevent overfitting
   - Visualize learned features and attention patterns

6. MODEL EVALUATION
   - Test on held-out test set
   - Calculate relevant metrics (accuracy, F1, BLEU, etc.)
   - Perform error analysis
   - Compare against baseline models

7. DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
   - Model compression techniques (pruning, quantization)
   - Inference optimization (TensorRT, ONNX)
   - A/B testing in production
   - Monitoring model performance drift
