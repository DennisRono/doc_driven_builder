# PyTorch Neural Network Tutorial

## Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks. In PyTorch, we can build neural networks using the `torch.nn` module.

## Basic Components

### Tensors

Tensors are the fundamental data structure in PyTorch. They are similar to NumPy arrays but can run on GPUs.

```python
import torch
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])
y = torch.randn(2, 3)
```

### Layers

Neural network layers are the building blocks of models:

- **Linear Layer**: Applies linear transformation `y = xW^T + b`
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh
- **Normalization**: BatchNorm, LayerNorm

### Loss Functions

Common loss functions include:

- CrossEntropyLoss for classification
- MSELoss for regression
- BCELoss for binary classification

## Building a Simple Network

To create a neural network:

1. Define the network architecture
2. Initialize weights
3. Forward pass computation
4. Backward pass (gradient computation)
5. Parameter updates

```python
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return self.fc2(x)
```

## Training Process

The training loop involves:

1. Forward pass through the network
2. Compute loss
3. Backward pass (compute gradients)
4. Update parameters using optimizer

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate learning rates
- Apply regularization techniques
- Monitor training and validation metrics
- Save model checkpoints regularly
